Eventually, this will contain samples of how to integrate https://form.io and Camunda.

Architecture:

2. Render Form
3. Provide a submit event that submits form data to the correct place. 

## Quick Start

1. Clone this project

Clone this `camunda-poc-starter-c7` project into your local machine

2. Start the Spring Boot Application

Open this project in Intellij and navigate to `src/main/java/io/camunda/starter/MyApplication.java`. 

Click the green triangle to start the project

3. Browse to the Form Builder

Once the Spring boot application starts, open your browser and navigate to:
